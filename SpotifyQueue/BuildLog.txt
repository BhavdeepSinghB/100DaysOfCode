Lay the foundation of a song, Node, and PlayList. Testing out my Java and OOP skills and just generally appreciating my love for linked lists.

Created playNext and playPrev functionality. Trying to figure out how to create a temporary queue with minimal code. Will try to work on a basic solution and then try to expand from that

I didn't realize that temporarily adding to a queue would be that simple. The project can be considered over since I now understand the working of a queue in a  music player. The advantage of doing it was getting the idea, which I was simmply overcomplicating
