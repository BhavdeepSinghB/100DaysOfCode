Started the project. 
Known issues:
1) Seconds output is wrong in most cases
2) Haven't added a case to add a timer for hours
3) Limited testing
4) Need to beautify it a little

Positive note: Logic works so technically achieved a working a timer, but need eed to work on its output

Timer bug fixed, one test case passed, will be working on more test cases as I begin writing the part to accomodate hours

Today's build done, minutes and seconds problem resolved, now moving on to hours. The problem is that hours aren't matching up, there is some problem in the way I'm calculating it.

With limited testing, the code seems to pass most test cases. Need to test something for midnight and make sure that works but it shouldn't be too much of a problem. Hopefully. Since I have added functionality for finalHr < incrementHr. But we shall see. 
Next goal is to add some GUI elements to make something pop up when the timer is done. But otherwise, it looks like I'm moving pretty fast towards a final build
