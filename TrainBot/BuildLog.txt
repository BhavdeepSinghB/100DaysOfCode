The rewrite version is really annoying when it comes to fetching and sending messages. I have also encountered some design flaws and will be talking with the mids about how we could resolve them. In an ideal scenario, the bot will be ready in a few days' time

Added functinos to save the current invite to a file in case the bot were ever to go offline. Also added fucntionality for people to share their invite back for the train to keep moving. A prototype seems ready. Now for testing with multiple people
