Started build, connected to test server and initialized stack. Plans to understand how to send and receive messages to paritcular users

The rewrite version is really annoying when it comes to fetching and sending messages. I have also encountered some design flaws and will be talking with the mids about how we could resolve them. In an ideal scenario, the bot will be ready in a few days' time

Added functinos to save the current invite to a file in case the bot were ever to go offline. Also added fucntionality for people to share their invite back for the train to keep moving. A prototype seems ready. Now for testing with multiple people

A basic bot is ready. It manages the train we want it tobut works only in an ideal scenario where people are giving back invites and claiming things in under 10 minutes.
I need to add a timer and something to validate the given invite since at the moment, all it is taking is a string

Jerk proofed this bot by adding a timer to check for responses, in case someone dissapears. They will now, not be able to claim the invite after 10 minutes. In additon, invalid invites are not accepted anymore
