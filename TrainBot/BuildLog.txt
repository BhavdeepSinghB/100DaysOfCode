Started build, connected to test server and initialized stack. Plans to understand how to send and receive messages to paritcular users

The rewrite version is really annoying when it comes to fetching and sending messages. I have also encountered some design flaws and will be talking with the mids about how we could resolve them. In an ideal scenario, the bot will be ready in a few days' time

Added functinos to save the current invite to a file in case the bot were ever to go offline. Also added fucntionality for people to share their invite back for the train to keep moving. A prototype seems ready. Now for testing with multiple people

A basic bot is ready. It manages the train we want it tobut works only in an ideal scenario where people are giving back invites and claiming things in under 10 minutes.
I need to add a timer and something to validate the given invite since at the moment, all it is taking is a string

Jerk proofed this bot by adding a timer to check for responses, in case someone dissapears. They will now, not be able to claim the invite after 10 minutes. In additon, invalid invites are not accepted anymore

Thanks to help from Tom, I've been able to see and correct design flaws. This project is teaching me how to deal with teamwork and code reviews. Something that school hasn't taught me well enough. I have to say I enjoy it, as long as my team has an open mind. 
Tom overall, has been really helpful and I appreciate all his help

Trying to bypass multithreading problem by adding a reminder message every 10 minutes. This would, at least to some extent, keep the train moving


[2019-03-27 18:03:46.115020]
Added a lot of functionality. Users can now remove themselves off the train, and if the person is the one who is supposed to get the invite, then that is hand handled as well.
In addition, we have a !train check fucntion to help people understand their position and basically a directory of all the cmmands available to the general public as a !train help function


[2019-03-28 20:11:35.392522]
Added functionality to check for returned invites, if the person doesn't submit an invite, TODO: Ban them. Else, the invite is given to the next person. Pending further testing
